////		Constructors and methods differ in three aspects of the signature: modifiers, return type, and name. Like methods, c
//		onstructors can have any of the access modifiers: public, protected, private, or none (often called package or friendly).
//		Unlike methods, constructors can take only access modifiers. Therefore, constructors cannot be abstract, final, native, static,
//
////
////		The return types are very different too. Methods can have any valid return type, or no return type, in which case the return 
//		type is given as void. Constructors have no return type, not even void.
////
////			Finally, in terms of the signature, methods and constructors have different names. Constructors have the same name as
//				their class; by convention, methods use names other than the class name. If the Java program follows normal conventions, 
//				methods will start with a lowercase letter, constructors with an uppercase letter. Also, constructor names are usually
//				nouns because class names are usually nouns; method names usually indicate actions.
